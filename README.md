# inventoryTracker
This is the Shopify intern challenge - summer 2022


# How to run:

#### To run this programm first clone the project and install npm in root directory using
```
npm install
```

Note: I have intentially left the config.env file in the rpeo to make it easier to access for the reviewer. For other projects I would ensure .env are hidden.

```
npm start
```
